## What Is Reproducible Science?

Let's start with the reproducible part.

* What is it?
* Why is it important?

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## What Is Reproducible Science?

Your workflow can be run by someone else on any computer.

---

## What Makes A Project Open?

---
class: middle, inverse

## A Few Characteristics of Open Reproducible Science Projects

* Data and tools are freely available (open)
* Workflow can be run from start to finish
* Approach and methods are well documented
* Code is ideally clean, well written, easy to read

## Why Use Reproducible Methods?


---
class: middle, inverse

## Reproducibility Benefits You

1. Helps to avoid / more quickly identify mistakes.
2. Makes it easier to collaborate on projects.
3. Reproducibility helps others build upon your work.
4. Ensures that more people have access to your work.

## How to Make Your Work Reproducible

> Make your data, code and documentation publicly available in a form that
> other people can find and use.


---
class: middle

## Four Aspects of Reproducibility

1. Organization & Clean Code
1. Documentation
1. Automation
1. Communication / Dissemination (Sharing)

---
class: middle

## 1. Organization - Files & Directories

* Create self explanatory file structures.
* Organize files in well-named directories

### Which Filenames Are Most Self-explanatory?

![human readible file names]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/slide-shows/intro-rr/human-readable-jenny.png)

---
class: middle
## 1. Use Expressive Variable Names

* Use self explanatory variable names.
* Comment code so your future self can understand it.

```python
# This is hard to understand
myvar = var1 - var2

# This uses more expressive variable names
canopy_height_model = lidar_dsm - lidar_dtm

```

---
## Use Standard Syntax PEP8

```python

#this is not useful or formatted correctly
randomVariableName

```

```python

# This is a nicely formatted comment space after the # sign
use_snake_case_for_variable_names

```

## PEP 8 Says: Import ALL Packages At the Top Of Your Code Document

```
# Import Packages
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

# Insert code below

```
---

## 2. Document all workflow steps:

* Remind your future self of your workflow.
* Others can see and understand your work.
* You can use markdown in Jupyter Notebooks to document a workflow!

---
class: middle

## Documentation Pro-Tips
> * Use open file formats: text files (.txt, .md) that don't require special tools to open.
> * Use Jupyter Notebooks (or RMarkdown) to connect data cleaning, analysis & results

---
class: middle
## 3. Automate Your Workflows

* Write code vs. graphical interface tools like ArcGIS or excel that require mouse "clicks".
* Don't repeat code: Using modular approaches instead including loops and functions.
* Develop scripted workflows using jupyter notebooks, scripts and other tools.

## DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself

> If your code has lines that repeat, it will be more time consuming to use.

```python
# Whoops! Forgot to import glob lol

import glob

csv_list = glob.glob("My_Data2003-boulder.csv")
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2004-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2005-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2006-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2007-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2011-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2012-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2013-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2008-boulder.csv"))
csv_list.append(glob.glob("My_Data2009-boulder.csv"))
```

## Automation - Create Modular Code

Use functions to write code in reusable chunks.
We won't learn about functions today but they are ideal to write cleaner code.

---

## 4. Communication: Tell People About Your Work

> Completing a project is only a part of the process. Communicating well will
> help you get a job and share you work with others.

---
## Facets of Reproducibility: Tools / Skills

1. Documentation: Jupyter Notebooks, Comments, GitHub
2. Organization:  File naming / organization, Expressive variable names, PEP8.
3. Automation: Loops, Functions, Writing code!
4. Communication: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Blog Posts
